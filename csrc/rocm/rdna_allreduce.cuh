// T44 — push-based one-shot all-reduce for small messages on gfx1030, W ranks (2..8).
//
// Ported from leapdragon/vllm-rdna2-qwen T44/T44b (Aron Hsiao). The VRAM-flag
// protocol and abort-record layout are the same as that tree.
//
// Descendant of the TP=2 WS2 kernel (builds/shared/ws2-allreduce/src/allreduce.hip.h), whose
// findings it keeps:
//   * push, never pull        — peer STORE 14.3 GB/s vs peer LOAD 5.7 GB/s across PCIe;
//   * staging is UNCACHED     — hipDeviceMallocUncached; a peer's write to coarse-grained
//                               memory lands in DRAM while the owner keeps reading stale L2;
//   * flags live in each rank's OWN uncached device memory (2026-08-30; they were a
//     host-coherent page before): a peer announces by one posted P2P store into our flag
//     slot and we poll locally — waiting no longer generates PCIe read traffic. With the
//     host page, four GPUs hammered system memory with 32-bit reads across both root
//     complexes for the whole barrier; on this machine that coincided with the SAS HBA's
//     tape drive resetting and, twice, with cards dropping off the PCIe bus. Coarse-grained
//     device memory would not work (a peer's write is invisible to the owner's L2, T18);
//     uncached memory is exactly what the staging buffers already use for the same reason.
//   * the sequence number is derived on-device from a local counter, never passed as a kernel
//     argument (frozen at CUDA-graph capture, so every replay would fall through the wait);
//   * bounded spins that set a sticky abort flag instead of hanging the GPU -- and, since
//     T44b, record which phase/peer/sequence aborted in a host-visible word (see below).
// New here: W-way staging (one slot per source rank, x2 parities), pushes fanned out to all
// peers, a W-flag wait, and a FIXED-ORDER fp32 reduction (rank 0 .. W-1) so every rank produces
// bit-identical output — with TP, ranks that disagree by an ulp diverge from each other.
//
// Layout of a rank's staging buffer (uncached device memory), in elements of T:
//   stage[(parity * W + src) * max_elems + i]
// Peer j receives our contribution at its slot src = our rank. Flags sit in a 4 KB page
// appended to the same uncached allocation, so the announce store cannot overtake the
// payload on that destination (posted-write order).
